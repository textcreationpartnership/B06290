            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>Firſt on the ſhore he ſtood a little ſpace</l>
                  <l>And thence unto a rock tranſported was,</l>
                  <l>Where he four days and nights did then remain</l>
                  <l>And never thought to ſee his friends again.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But as a Turkiſh ſhip was paſſing by</l>
                  <l>Some of the men the Gentleman did ſpy,</l>
                  <l>And took him in and as I underſtand,</l>
                  <l>They carried him into the Turkiſh Land.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And there (not knowing of his ſad diſaſter)</l>
                  <l>They quickly did provide for him a Maſter,</l>
                  <l>A Surgeon or of ſome ſuch like profeſſion,</l>
                  <l>Whoſe ſervice he performed with much diſcretion.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>It ſéems in gathering Hearbs he had good skill,</l>
                  <l>And could the ſame excéeding well diſtil,</l>
                  <l>Which to his Maſter great content did give,</l>
                  <l>And pleaſ'd him well ſo long as he did live.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But he ſoon dyd, and at his death he gave him,</l>
                  <l>A piece of plate that ſo none ſhould enſlave him,</l>
                  <l>But that his liberty be might obtain,</l>
                  <l>To come into his native land again.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And thus this Gentleman his fréedom wrought;</l>
                  <l>And by a <hi>Turky</hi> Ship from thence was brought;</l>
                  <l>To <hi>Portugal,</hi> and now both ſafe and ſound,</l>
                  <l>He is at length arrived on Engliſh ground.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Let not this ſéem incredible to any,</l>
                  <l>Becauſe it is a thing afirmed by many,</l>
                  <l>This is no feigned ſtory, though tis new,</l>
                  <l>But as tis very ſtrange tis very true.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>You ſée how far a Witches power extends,</l>
                  <l>When as to wickedneſs her mind ſhe bends,</l>
                  <l>Great is her Malice, yet can God reſtrain her,</l>
                  <l>And at his pleaſure let her looſe or chain her.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>If God had let her work her utmoſt ſpight,</l>
                  <l>No doubt ſhe would have kild the man outright,</l>
                  <l>But he is ſaved and ſhe for all her malice,</l>
                  <l>Was very juſtly hang'd upon the Gallows.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Then let all praiſe to God alone be given,</l>
                  <l>By men on earth as by the Saints in heaven,</l>
                  <l>He by his mercy dayly doth befriend us,</l>
                  <l>And by his power he will ſtill defend us.</l>
